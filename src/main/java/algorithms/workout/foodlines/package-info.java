 * <strong>Problem Description</strong>
 * <p>
 * <br/><br/>
 * <p>
 * After many years of continuous warfare, the country of Collea was left in shambles. This has
 * caused food shortages and famines all across the country. In an attempt to distribute the little
 * food that was produced and prevent food hoarding, the Collean government limited the amount of
 * food that any one person can buy. Soon, Collean citizens are forced to wait in long lines in
 * order to obtain the food they needed. There are currently <em>N</em> such food lines in the city
 * of Lachtin, the <em>i</em>-th of which has <em>a</em><sub>i</sub> people in it. <em>M</em> people
 * are going to enter one of the lines in the next hour, where they each enter the shortest line
 * they see. Since Phreia plans to enter the line, she wants to know the length of the line that
 * each person decides to join.
 * <p>
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * <strong>Input Specification</strong>
 * <p>
 * <br/><br/>
 * <p>
 * The first line contains two positive integers, N and M.<br/> The second line contains N positive
 * integers, a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, â€¦ , a<sub>N</sub> .
 * <p>
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * <strong>Output Specification</strong>
 * <p>
 * <br/><br/> Print M lines, the <em>i</em>-th of which being the length of the line that the
 * <em>i</em>-th person joined.
